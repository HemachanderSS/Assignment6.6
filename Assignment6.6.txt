1.Difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler:
	*FIFO scheduler:
		*The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and rund them in the order 
of submission i.e fist in,first out.
		*A small file has to wait until the large file precading it in the queue
to execute first.
	
	*capactiy scheduler:
		The capactiy scheduler is designed to allow a large cluster while giving
each organization a minimum capacity guarantee.
		The central idea is that the available resources in the Hadoop-Map-REduce
cluster are partitioned among multiple organizations who collectively fund the cluster 
based on computing needs.
		There is an added benefit that an organization can access any excess capacity
no being used by others.
		It provides elasticity for the organizations in a cost-effective manner.


2.Limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x:
	*In hadoop 1.x all the operations such as utilization and job monitoring are 
monitored by job tracker where in hadoop 2.x which can be handled by splitting the task to resource
manager, node manager and the application manager.
	*The number of nodes that can be fit into the cluster has been scaled up from 4000 
to 10000.
	*Hadoop 2.x supports other processing models other than map reduce model.
	*Hadoop 2.x resource allocation is dynamic.
